#Sketchify Open Source Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in **Sketchify** which is an open source development project allowing users to test and showcase their *HTML, CSS and Javascript* snippets, as well as reporting unacceptable behaviour. 

#Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming project,we as contributors are committed to build a safe, welcoming and friendly environment for all the contributors of Sketchify, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other protected categories under applicable law.

#Our Standards
* **Be friendly and patient**: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
* **Be welcoming**: Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be respectful**: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
    - Violent threats or language.
    - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting, or threatening to post, people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
    - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
    - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
    - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
* **Understand disagreements**: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
> Note: This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

#Our Resposibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

#Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and public spaces when an individual is representing *Sketcify*. Examples of representing *Sketchify* include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

#Reporting and Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at shubhamkatte99@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by members of the project's leadership.

Actions we may take in such instances include (but are not limited to) the following:

   * Locking conversations
   * Blocking users
   * Reporting users to Github

As an individual user on Github, you also have the option to block a user from your personal account or to report a user to Github yourself, but the existence of these functions will not be used as a reason for inaction on our part.
